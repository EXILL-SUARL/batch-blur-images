# Installation
NPM:

**Note:** This library is native [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and does not provides a CommonJS export. If your project uses CommonJS, you'll have to convert to ESM or use the [dynamic `import()`](https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import) function.
